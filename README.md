#Travel_Reminders  
This is an app that registers your travel date  
and the important things that you'll have to carry while  
travelling. It then sends automated messages and  
emails to the person about an hour before his/her  
journey to remind him/her about those possessions .  
Also , once the user registers a travel date , an  
email will be sent to him/her , so that , he/she can  
use it on his/her android device to import them to  
their calendar .  
(And this has to be deployed on a server so that the program can stay active )
